# TravellingSalesmanProblem

I wanted to dig into the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Computing_a_solution) for a friend who is in bicyle delivery and by the way, it was a good chance to use PrimeNG and Leaflet for the first time.

This Angular 10 Project uses
- [PrimeNG](https://primefaces.org/primeng/showcase/#/)
- [NGXS Store](https://www.ngxs.io/) with Storage and DevTools Plugin
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) + [ngxLeaflet](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet)
- [Open Route Service API](https://openrouteservice.org/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
